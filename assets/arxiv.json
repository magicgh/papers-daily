Deep visual fingerprinting models have recently been explored for this purpose. However, they are not robust to tiny input perturbations known as adversarial examples. First we illustrate how to generate valid adversarial images that can easily cause incorrect image attribution. Then we describe an approach to prevent imperceptible adversarial attacks on deep visual fingerprinting models, via robust contrastive learning. The proposed training procedure leverages training on $\\ell_\\infty$-bounded adversarial examples, it is conceptually simple and incurs only a small computational overhead. The resulting models are substantially more robust, are accurate even on unperturbed images, and perform well even over a database with millions of images. In particular, we achieve 91.6% standard and 85.1% adversarial recall under $\\ell_\\infty$-bounded perturbations on manipulated images compared to 80.1% and 0.0% from prior work.

If working with video frames can increase the number of these instances, it has a major disadvantage: the resulting images will be highly correlated with one another.

This paper proposes UniSeg, an effective approach to automatically train models across multiple datasets with differing label spaces, without any manual relabeling efforts. Specifically, we propose two losses that account for conflicting and co-occurring labels to achieve better generalization performance in unseen domains. First, a gradient conflict in training due to mismatched label spaces is identified and a class-independent binary cross-entropy loss is proposed to alleviate such label conflicts. Second, a loss function that considers class-relationships across datasets is proposed for a better multi-dataset training scheme.

In this work, we propose a principled approach for robust training of over-parameterized deep networks in classification tasks where a proportion of training labels are corrupted. The main idea is yet very simple: label noise is sparse and incoherent with the network learned from clean data, so we model the noise and learn to separate it from the data. Specifically, we model the label noise via another sparse over-parameterization term, and exploit implicit algorithmic regularizations to recover and separate the underlying corruptions. Remarkably, when trained using such a simple method in practice, we demonstrate state-of-the-art test accuracy against label noise on a variety of real datasets.

It aims to be of use for both newcomers, who wish to get a grasp of the field, and for more experienced readers that might benefit from seeing current research trends and existing tools laid out. Among StyleGAN's most interesting aspects is its learned latent space. Despite being learned with no supervision, it is surprisingly well-behaved and remarkably disentangled. Combined with StyleGAN's visual quality, these properties gave rise to unparalleled editing capabilities. However, the control offered by StyleGAN is inherently limited to the generator's learned distribution, and can only be applied to images generated by StyleGAN itself. Seeking to bring StyleGAN's latent control to real-world scenarios, the study of GAN inversion and latent space embedding has quickly gained in popularity. Meanwhile, this same study has helped shed light on the inner workings and limitations of StyleGAN. We map out StyleGAN's impressive story through these investigations, and discuss the details that have made StyleGAN the go-to generator.

To aggravate the problem, the errors to be detected in the workouts are very subtle. To that end, we propose to learn exercise-specific representations from unlabeled samples such that a small dataset annotated by experts suffices for supervised error detection. In particular, our domain knowledge-informed self-supervised approaches exploit the harmonic motion of the exercise actions, and capitalize on the large variances in camera angles, clothes, and illumination to learn powerful representations. To facilitate our self-supervised pretraining, and supervised finetuning, we curated a new exercise dataset, Fitness-AQA, comprising of three exercises: BackSquat, BarbellRow, and OverheadPress.

The low-level controller takes the resulting waypoints as a reference trajectory and computes high-resolution control inputs by solving a simplified formulation of a multi-agent racing game. We consider two approaches for the low-level planner to construct two hierarchical controllers. One approach uses multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), and the other solves a linear-quadratic Nash game (LQNG) to produce control inputs. We test the controllers against three baselines: an end-to-end MARL controller, a MARL controller tracking a fixed racing line, and an LQNG controller tracking a fixed racing line. Quantitative results show that the proposed hierarchical methods outperform their respective baseline methods in terms of head-to-head race wins and abiding by the rules. The hierarchical controller using MARL for low-level control consistently outperformed all other methods by winning over 88\\% of head-to-head races and more consistently adhered to the complex racing rules.

Nonetheless, various forms of regularization, such as \"explicit regularization\" (via weight decay), are often used to avoid overfitting, especially when the data is corrupted. There are several challenges with explicit regularization, most notably unclear convergence properties. Inspired by convergence properties of stochastic mirror descent (SMD) algorithms, we propose a new method for training DNNs with regularization, called regularizer mirror descent (RMD). In highly overparameterized DNNs, SMD simultaneously interpolates the training data and minimizes a certain potential function of the weights. RMD starts with a standard cost which is the sum of the training loss and a convex regularizer of the weights. Reinterpreting this cost as the potential of an \"augmented\" overparameterized network and applying SMD yields RMD. As a result, RMD inherits the properties of SMD and provably converges to a point \"close\" to the minimizer of this cost. RMD is computationally comparable to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and weight decay, and is parallelizable in the same manner. Our experimental results on training sets with various levels of corruption suggest that the generalization performance of RMD is remarkably robust and significantly better than both SGD and weight decay, which implicitly and explicitly regularize the $\\ell_2$ norm of the weights.

Supervised MLs are very effective in detecting known threats, but struggle in identifying zero-day attacks (unknown during learning phase), which instead can be detected through unsupervised MLs. Unfortunately, there are no definitive answers on the combined use of both approaches for network intrusion detection. In this paper we first expand the problem of zero-day attacks and motivate the need to combine supervised and unsupervised algorithms. We propose the adoption of meta-learning, in the form of a two-layer Stacker, to create a mixed approach that detects both known and unknown threats.

Most of the existing methods assume that a reliable multi-modal training set with accurately matched text-image pairs is existing. However, this assumption may not always hold since the multi-modal training sets may include noisy pairs (i.e., textual descriptions/captions associated to training images can be noisy), distorting the learning process of the retrieval methods. To address this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised cross-modal hashing method robust to the noisy image-text correspondences (CHNR). CHNR consists of three modules: 1) feature extraction module, which extracts feature representations of image-text pairs; 2) noise detection module, which detects potential noisy correspondences; and 3) hashing module that generates cross-modal binary hash codes. The proposed CHNR includes two training phases: i) meta-learning phase that uses a small portion of clean (i.e., reliable) data to train the noise detection module in an adversarial fashion; and ii) the main training phase for which the trained noise detection module is used to identify noisy correspondences while the hashing module is trained on the noisy multi-modal training set.

The final transfer learned DGCN-LSTM model performs well to predict evacuation traffic flow (RMSE=399.69).

However, the computational cost of the \\textit{ab initio} calculations required by CSPA limits its utility to small unit cells, reducing the compositional and structural space the algorithms can explore. Past studies have bypassed many unneeded \\textit{ab initio} calculations by utilizing machine learning methods to predict formation energy and determine the stability of a material. Specifically, graph neural networks display high fidelity in predicting formation energy. Traditionally graph neural networks are trained on large data sets of relaxed structures. Unfortunately, the geometries of unrelaxed candidate structures produced by CSPA often deviate from the relaxed state, which leads to poor predictions hindering the model's ability to filter energetically unfavorable prior to \\textit{ab initio} evaluation. This work shows that the prediction error on relaxed structures reduces as training progresses, while the prediction error on unrelaxed structures increases, suggesting an inverse correlation between relaxed and unrelaxed structure prediction accuracy.
